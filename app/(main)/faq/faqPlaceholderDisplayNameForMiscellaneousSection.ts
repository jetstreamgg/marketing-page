    question: 'What is the Sky Forum, and how does it differ from other discussion platforms?',
    answer: `The [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/) (formerly the Maker Forum) is a public discussion platform group that includes conversation threads, tagging, categorization and active moderation. It is formally used for discussions focused mainly on Sky Ecosystem Governance and risk. Other platforms used by the Sky Ecosystem community, such as [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skyecosystem) and X ([@SkyEcosystem](https://x.com/SkyEcosystem)), are much less formal, more ad hoc.`,
